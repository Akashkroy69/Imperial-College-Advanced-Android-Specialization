# Peer-graded Assignment: 3D Dancing Robot

I would like you to create an Android app which will show a 3D robot dancing on the screen.  
In the detailed assignment instructions, I have broken down this assignment into chunks to help make things more manageable.  
Please review the materials in the previous modules if you get stuck, all the content you need is in here.
